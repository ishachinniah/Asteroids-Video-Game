## Asteroids-Video-Game

This is the 1979 space themed video game implemented in Java in collaboration with 3 team members. The program utilises abstractions through which different objects are pulled together into the final interface. The AbstractAnimation.java file and AbstractObject.java file provide basic functioning animations and objects that are utilised during the game. Within the animatedObjects folder, instances of a ship, bullet, and asteroid are created that can be used during the game; additionally, the AnimationDemos folder consists of animations/motions for the ship, bullet, and asteroids. Finally the MyGame.java file is the main program that creats an interface for the user to play the game.

WELCOME STATEMENT
Congratulations on completing your basic pilot training, and becoming an A.C.E! We hope you've enjoyed your journey to get to the Terran Interglactic Station (T.I.S). Due to the gravitational differences from the ATARAI Planet Cluster and your home planet System, Sol, the aircrafts you'll be piloting here have a modified control system than what you are used to. Please take the time to familiarize yourself with the following before embarking on your adventure:
------------------------
-UP_ARROW -> Activate THRUST to change ship's moving trajectory towards where your ship is facing. Increases speed.
-DOWN_ARROW -> Reverse THRUST to slow down the aircraft. Useful to avoid incoming asteroids.
-LEFT_ARROW -> STEER the ship to rotate towards the LEFT. Does not change movement direction unless you activate THRUST.
-RIGHT_ARROW -> STEER the ship to rotate towards the RIGHT. Does not change movement direction unless you activate THRUST.
-SPACE_BAR -> SHOOT bullets in the direction your aircraft is currently facing.
-H_KEY -> Activate HYPERSPACE. Teleport your ship anywhere in the Asteroid Area. Useful for a quick getaway, but could end in disaster if you're unlucky enough to teleport into an asteroid
----------------------------

MISSION CRITICAL INFORMATION

___MOVEMENT:
Please be aware that the heavy gravity in the ATARI Planet Cluster is especially bad in the Asteroid Area. Therefore, your ship will not be able to mantain its speed, and will slow down as time goes on if THRUST is not engaged. Additionally, once all asteroids have been destroyed, the sudden shift in the space-matter will cause additional asteroids to appear. They will be larger in number, and faster. Don't worry, with your training and courage you will be able to handle them perfectly. Probably.

___POINTS:
Every asteroid you kill will yield 500 points to your A.C.E Balance. Every time you gain an additonal 10000 points, Terran Command will provide you with one more Shield Charge to use in case of collision.

___LIVES:
An A.C.E SHIP comes with three Shield Charges. Upon collision with an asteroid, the charge will destroy the 'roid and hyperspace the ship to center of the Asteroid Area. For the next 1.2 seconds, your ship will phase through space-matter in such way that it will be immune to any collisions. Be careful not to be inside an asteroid when the protection wears off! 

___GAME OVER
Due to the A.C.E SHIP's engeneers' sense of humor, you'll see these Shield Charges labeled as "Lives" on your dashboard. Do not be concerned you do not die once you are out of "lives". We will automatically teleport you back to the T.I.S safe and sound. And Alive. We Promise <3.

---------------------------------------------------------
WOW! LOOK out the window of your space shuttle!! You can see two beautful asteroids floating by. They might look really cool up close, but they are a nightmare for humans trying to set roots in the ATARAI Planet Cluster. You're going to be changing lives during your time here! 

Good Luck, Ace!

Thank you, and we hope you enjoy your time abroad the Terran Intergalactic Station
