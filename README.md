#Asteroids Video Game
This is a Java implementation of the 1979 space-themed video game, created in collaboration with three team members. The program utilizes abstractions to integrate various objects into the final interface.

In the src folder, you'll find AbstractAnimation.java and AbstractObject.java, which provide essential animations and objects for the game. Within the animatedObjects folder, instances of a ship, bullet, and asteroid are created for gameplay. Additionally, the AnimationDemos folder contains files for implementing animations and motions for the ship, bullet, and asteroids. Finally, MyGame.java serves as the main program, creating an interface for users to play the game.

The test folder includes test files for implementing asteroid, bullet, ship, and game animations.

Keep reading for instructions on how to play the game!

##WELCOME STATEMENT

Congratulations on completing your basic pilot training and becoming an A.C.E! We hope you've enjoyed your journey to the Terran Intergalactic Station (T.I.S). Before embarking on your adventures, please take a moment to familiarize yourself with the following controls:

up_arrow: Activate THRUST to change the ship's trajectory toward its facing direction, increasing speed.
down_arrow: Reverse THRUST to decelerate the ship, useful for avoiding asteroids.
left_arrow: STEER the ship to rotate left. Movement direction remains unchanged unless THRUST is activated.
right_arrow: STEER the ship to rotate right. Movement direction remains unchanged unless THRUST is activated.
space_bar: SHOOT bullets in the direction the ship is facing.
H_key: Activate HYPERSPACE to teleport the ship anywhere in space, ideal for quick escapes.
MISSION CRITICAL INFORMATION

MOVEMENT:
The heavy gravity in the Atari Planet Cluster's Asteroid Area causes ships to gradually lose speed if THRUST isn't engaged. Destroying all asteroids triggers the appearance of more, larger, and faster asteroids. With your training and courage, you'll handle them perfectly. Probably.

POINTS:
Each destroyed asteroid yields 500 points to your A.C.E Balance. Every 10,000 additional points earn you an extra Shield Charge from Terran Command.

LIVES:
An A.C.E SHIP comes equipped with three Shield Charges. Upon asteroid collision, a charge destroys the asteroid and hyperspaces the ship to the asteroid area's center. For the next 1.2 seconds, your ship phases through space-matter, becoming collision-immune. Be cautious of your surroundings when the protection expires!

GAME OVER
Shield Charges are humorously labeled as "Lives" on your dashboard. Running out won't end your game; you'll be automatically teleported back to T.I.S safe and sound. We promise, you'll be alive and well. <3

Take a moment to gaze out the window of your space shuttle! You'll see two beautiful asteroids floating by. While they may seem captivating up close, they pose a significant challenge for humans settling in the Atari Planet Cluster. Get ready to make a difference during your time here!

Good luck, Ace!

Thank you, and we hope you enjoy your time aboard the Terran Intergalactic Station.
